Contains the website I created in CS50 and some Folium maps used in my post on Medium:

[Use Machine Learning to Create B2B Sales Territories](https://medium.com/@jamescage/use-machine-learning-to-create-b2b-sales-territories-eb4e36f0bf18)

Okay, why did I put the Folium maps here? So that links from the Medium post could open the maps in a separate window. Poor practice, James, poor practice.
