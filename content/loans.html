    <p>The Indian elephant population is facing a difficult battle for survival. Despite existing conservation efforts, the elephant population is decreasing—and poachers are to blame. In order to protect these majestic creatures, conservationists are now turning to a unique solution: arming the elephants with self-protection devices.</p>
    <p>The concept is simple yet effective. Elephants are outfitted with special collars that are equipped with cameras and sensors that detect sound and movement. When the sensors detect a poacher, the collars instantly alert a nearby ranger who can then respond to the threat. This approach is proving to be beneficial, as conservationists have reported a decline in poaching activity due to the self-protection devices.</p>
    <p>In addition to the collars, conservationists are using other methods such as guard towers and drones to keep poachers away. By utilizing both the self-protection devices and other technologies, conservationists are taking the necessary steps to ensure that India's elephant population is preserved for future generations.</p>
